The UI components are organized into Activities, which we learned about in this lesson. The behind-the-scenes work is handled by other Android classes including:
*Content Providers (Lesson 4) - Manage app data
*Services (Lesson 6) - Run background tasks with no UI, such as downloading information or playing music.
*Broadcast Receivers (Lesson 6) - Listen for and respond to system announcements, such as the screen being turned on or losing network connectivity.

To turn XML into java View object, we need to inflate the layout.
After layout is inflated it needs to be associated with activity.
To associate with activity, call setContentView in oncreate method
