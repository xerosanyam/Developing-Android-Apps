Note:
once adapter has been set for a list, you just have to change values in adapter & not touch listView
during creation of arrayAdapter you need to pass arraylist, however while updating you can add values 1 by 1. (adapter.add(string)) or allatOnce (addAll)
adapter must be made global
arrayAdapter internally calls adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()

add is less efficient as compared to addAll
add notifies(updates) list on adding each element
addAll updates list at once

@Override
        protected void onPostExecute(String[] strings) {
            if(strings!=null){
                arrayAdapter.clear();
                arrayAdapter.addAll(strings)
            }
        }
