	contract?
		agreement b/w data model, storage, views describing hw infom is accessed
		list of constants	db col name
		
	while designing table
		any info that will be redundant?
		id must be present to uniquely identify each row
		id should be set to autoincrement
		separate table must be created in case of redundant data & linked to existing date by foreign key.
		
	foreign_key
		constraint, restricts adding values that are not in primary key
	
What exactly is to be done:
	1.	define class with constants having name you want for column			--THis is called contract
		
			implement BaseColumn interface
			
	2. create db with help of SQLiteOpenHelper
		onCreate(): the first time data base is used, this is called
		
		JUnti
		Testing framework, allows to write automated test suites.
		
		onUpgrade()
		version must be changed if change in table is made
		delete the data if not server generated
		keep the data if user generated

	3. Reading/writing on db
		getReference to database from SQLiteOpenHelper->instance of SQLite database object
			write: 		create ContentValue which represent row; contains set of key value pairs
						insert in row will return long val; which is row id, -1 if err
			
			read:		query data using query() which returns a cursor
		
			validate:	contentValues with values from cursor
